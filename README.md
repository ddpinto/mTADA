# mTADA uses de novo mutations (DNMs) to jointly analyze two traits. 


The package needs the information of single traits which can be obtained by using extTADA. If we have single-trait results (from extTADA) then we can use 2.1. If we don't have single-trait results then we can re-run extTADA for each trait and then run mTADA (see 2.2).

# 1. Requirements

We need to install two packages: *rstan* and *locfit*

# 2. Running mTADA

## 2.1 Running mTADA when single-trait parameters are available

Please follow this link: [Running_mTADA_from_single-trait_results.ipynb](Running_mTADA_from_single-trait_results.ipynb)

## 2.2 Running mTADA with only summary statistics (variant counts for each gene)
